- 👋 Hi, I’m @whetstone1
- 👀 I’m interested in building apps with words to bring people together :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack developing! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting and meaningful projects, with other people who like to think! 
- 📫 How to reach me: cole.whetstone@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm one of the best speakers of Ancient Greek in the world, and taught Ancient Greek for Jesus College, Oxford, before I discovered coding. The skills are not actually that different, funnily enough.
